											<h2 id="content">Summary</h2>
											<p>I’ve never been the kind of person satisfied to sit with problems if I could go out and find solutions. I love breaking down data to bring out the stories hidden within and sharing insights in a way that is comprehensive, comprehensible, and (most importantly) actionable to all stakeholders. </p>
											<p>For the past five years, I’ve worked as an English as a Second Language teacher. In this role, I helped students set goals and taught them the linguistic skills needed to achieve them. During that time, though, I also experienced how policies are not always implemented as written or designed with the most marginalized students in mind. I frequently spent my free time advocating for improved transparency, accountability, and compliance from DC’s schools including issues around open meetings for charter schools, accuracy in data reporting, and adequate internal controls around maintenance in city-owned buildings. </p>
											<p>My desire to change careers solidified through a project that I began in September 2021. After hearing frustration from parents and colleagues about the scarcity of accessible information on COVID cases and mitigation efforts in DC Public Schools, I decided to uncover that information myself. I developed a process to aggregate, clean, analyze, visualize, and share the disparate datasets I found via a dashboard website. I’ve used the insights from my analysis to inform testimony to and correspondence with the DC City Council and the DC State Board of Education, coauthor a policy brief with a parent advocacy group, uncover additional required but unreported information through FOIA requests, file complaints with the DC Inspector General about ongoing noncompliance from district agencies, and write blog posts about education oversight issues in the city.</p>
											<p>Through my professional experience, education, and personal projects, I’ve cultivated communicative and analytical skills that would transition naturally to this new career path. I also engage in continuous learning every day to gain additional skills and knowledge that will help me make the leap between my previous profession and my next opportunity. Now, I'm looking for an organization that can use my technical mindset, passion for transparent and accountable government, and experience in education policy and practice to advance an equity-minded mission.</p>
